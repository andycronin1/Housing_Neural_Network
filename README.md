# Housing_Neural_Network

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), we build a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan. This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.

Complete with data pipeline and neural network prediciton. Model Performance Evaluation to be added.
